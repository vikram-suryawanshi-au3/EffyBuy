                        #1 Better Supplier Relationship
                    </div>
                        For any procurement activity to be successful the main component involved 
                        is maintaining a healthy relationship with their suppliers. 
                        There needs to be set of trustworthy suppliers for an active and professional 
                        procurement leaders. Hence, building and maintaining good supplier relationships 
                        streamlines the procurement process and eliminates the need to start from scratch 
                        on every bid request. Detailed, fair and appropriate information based negotiation makes any 
                        suppliers confident and happier for long term relationships

                        #2 Think before making any purchase
                    </div>
                        Procurement process includes reduction of cost, while purchasing any goods / products
                        for company needs. Procurement reduces costs while obtaining the items a company needs. 
                        But just by considering that the procurement is reducing cost every time the purchase order 
                        is created, might be just a perception. So continuously, surveying how much is required, 
                        what is required and communicating that to the teams on regular basis can make a 
                        business run smarter ways. Creating contracts based on right negotiation deals is 
                        an important factor to be considered while making any purchase. Hence use of technology 
                        to include all the above steps would make the process move smoothly once a decision is made 
                        to purchase, and makes it easy to review contracts 
                        and ensure all orders as per the requirement

                        To be a good negotiator means; you have to have the knack of 
                        building and developing good relationships. Making a good deal for an organization 
                        while keeping suppliers happy can be a task in itself, but developing strategies

                    making 100’s of calls, and in the process things might get muddled up, thus leading 
                    to confusion. As too many people involved, too many communications, and conversations.
