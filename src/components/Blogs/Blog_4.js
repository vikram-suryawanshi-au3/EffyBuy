                    Purchases cost account for majority of costs in business environment. 
                    Most of the companies today know that reducing on procurement cost will 
                    not only contribute to their profitability; but also increase their business 
                    competitiveness. However, when questioned about this to any supplier, reduction 
                    in procurement cost is not enough. There has to be knowledge about 
                    future purchases and how price control can happen for next transactions.

                    often used interchangeably, though they are not the same. Purchasing refers to 
                    buying goods / products on behalf of the company while procurement describes all 
                    of the steps involved in obtaining them.
