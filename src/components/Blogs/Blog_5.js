                    Every sale and transaction that a business deals with daily can transform the business’s 
                    future. This makes the development of a procurement strategy a

                    What is procurement? 
                    </div>
                    Procurement is the obtaining of the best products and services at the best possible 
                    price in a series of steps that are important for any organization or business.

                <div className="individual_blog_paragraph">
                    Traditional procurement is identified by manual events like calling the vendors and 
                    buyers, approvals, writing RFX’s, negotiations, etc. that include repetitive 
                    and small tasks. However, these processes are not very 
                    efficient or accurate and thus require many follow-ups.

                    With an understanding of the best features, policies, and benefits while abiding by 
                    social and corporate responsibilities, 
                    one needs to understand the prevalent challenges in procurement.

                <div className="individual_blog_paragraph">
                    Procurement processes are riddled with challenges and difficulties and the 
                    leaders have an array of responsibilities to handle. These challenges are 
                    based on the organization’s line of work, size, 
                    etc, however, some of the common challenges and the ways to overcome them are -

                    <div style={{"fontWeight":"bold"}}>Problem</div>

                    Risks are involved in every aspect of the business and supply risks, market risks, 
                    frauds, cost, quality, etc, comprise the most common risks that are involved in the procurement process. 
                    Additionally, risks like anti-corruption and policy adherence are also involved. 
                    <br/>
                    These risks can be fatal for the complete cycle of the supply chain process 
                    and thus it becomes significant to understand these risks.

                    Active and extensive information search, substantial conflict and political 
                    bargaining, preference for formal decision rules, emphasis on strong buyer 
                    relationships, and established and enhanced communication networks can help 
                    mitigate the risks involved.

                        #2 Lack of understanding supplier capabilities before purchase
                    </div>
                    <div style={{"fontWeight":"bold"}}>Problem</div>

                    Finding the right supplier that understands the importance of quality and 
                    delivers in time can keep any dissatisfaction related to the procurement processes away. 
                    Having high expectations from a supplier for the completion of a procurement 
                    deal beyond their capabilities can be disastrous in the end. 
                    <br/>
                    The best solution to this is regular evaluation and continuous monitoring. 
                    Supplier performance can be monitored by ensuring that delivery demands 
                    and standards are met. A good supplier relationship
                     is important for the smooth functioning of the procurement process.

                    Holding a regular supply review, discussing key performance KPI, and agreeing on 
                    improvement and action ideas can also help overcome this challenge.

                    <div style={{"fontWeight":"bold"}}>Problem</div>

                    Withholding of important information by the organizations tends to create procurement 
                    problems as it limits the suppliers from offering the best and jam-packed deals to the 
                    clients. Also, organizations usually keep the suppliers at arm’s length and this 
                    treatment is similar to the one filled with zero confidence.

                    <div style={{"fontWeight":"bold"}}>Solution</div>
                    To avoid these, ask for supplier’s demands and details in advance to offer quality 
                    services. Also, keep a request line open to ensure that any updates and changes 
                    about these can be included. Having some trust towards your key 
                    suppliers can yield your problem-solving methods and give positive improvements.

                    Inaccurate data can lead to ill-informed or bad decisions which can ultimately 
                    reflect as loss in the business cycle. Access to accurate data is important as it 
                    helps to put up a strong front in the front of management or the decision 
                    makers and it helps slim the chance of being unsuccessful.

                    These challenges in procurement hinder the growth of the business and create room 
                    for financial and operational losses. However, procurement should 
                    be a strategic and insightful process rather than based on instincts. 
                    <br/>
                    Procurement is the entire process of sourcing, negotiating, imperative and strategic selections, 
                    and many other steps. The implementation of the best procurement processes will 
                    help seek a comprehensive approach and integrate different measures and 
                    high-performance processes to solve these problems.
