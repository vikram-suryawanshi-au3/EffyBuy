                    </div>
                    In a negotiation, your best source of power is your ability and willingness 
                    to listen to NO and get on to another deal. Before arriving at the bargaining table, 
                    wise negotiators spend significant time identifying their best alternative 
                    to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA, and taking steps to improve it

                    </div>
                    Research shows that it’s not always feasible to engage in small talk at the 
                    start of a negotiation, but doing so can bring real benefits. You and your 
                    counterpart may be more collaborative and likely to reach an agreement if you 
                    spend even just a few minutes trying to get to know each other. 
                    If you’re negotiating over email, even a brief introductory phone call may make a difference. 
                    This is one of the most valuable negotiation skills to master.

                        #3 Listen actively
                    </div>
                    Once you start discussing deal, resist the common urge to think about what 
                    you’re going to say next while your counterpart is talking. Instead, listen 
                    carefully to the arguments, then paraphrase what you believe is said to check 
                    your understanding. Acknowledge any difficult feelings, like unable to get the 
                    meaning behind the message. Not only are you likely to acquire valuable information, 
                    but the other party may mimic your exemplary listening skills.

                    </div>
                    In a typical negotiation, parties are often stuck making concessions and 
                    demands on a single issue, such as price. In some other negotiations, you 
                    can capitalize on the presence of multiple issues to get both sides more of 
                    what they want. Specifically, try to identify issues that your counterpart cares 
                    deeply about that you value less. Then propose making a concession on that issue 
                    in exchange for a concession on an issue you value highly.

                    Always try to place a timelines and milestones for your contract to ensure that 
                    commitments are met both the parties. You might also agree, in writing, to meet at 
                    regular intervals throughout the life of the 
                    contract to check in and, if necessary, renegotiate.

                    There are five styles of negotiations based on “win-lose” theory.

                        <li>
                            The “competing” style makes you the winner and the other the loser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The “accommodating” style results in others winning while you lose.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The “compromising” style occurs when everyone loses something and wins something.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        The “collaborating” style brings about a solution favorable to everyone, and nobody loses.

                <div className="individual_blog_paragraph">
                    Sometimes it is better to use the “accommodating” style on issues which 
                    are unimportant to you but very important for the other party to contribute 
                    to building a productive relationship. 
                    And remember – compromising doesn’t rhyme with the best style!

                    How to deal with deadlocks

                <div className="individual_blog_paragraph">
                    There is a deadlock in every negotiation, and sometimes there is more than one. 
                    Don’t be afraid of it and try to blame or point someone else or yourself also for it. 
                    An easy way to deal with a deadlock is to move to the next issue on your agenda and 
                    leave the complicated ones for later. Repeat this with every hurdle point and come back 
                    to them later in the session or take some time to 
                    think about it and add it to the next session’s agenda.

                    You don’t have to say “yes” or “no” right now! Take time to think.
